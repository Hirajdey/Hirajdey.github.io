                                    <p>Advances in genetic testing have been crucial to discovering the underlying causes of several endocrine disorders. They act as a guide for treatment, as well as for applying preventive measures for other family members. As genome sequencing continues to reveal the functions and dysfunctions of particular genes, genetic tests are better, especially when hormone tests provide ambiguous results. From common health issues like thyroid disease to rare adrenal tumours, these tests can reveal the inheritable component of a person’s condition and can guide the approach to treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment can significantly impact a person’s prognosis. Several molecular testing options are available in MedGenome to help in diagnostic confirmation and risk assessment for family members.</p>

                                    <li><span>Patients with lipid disorders have trouble maintaining normal levels of body fats, and these disorders can be found in several conditions that require special management, including metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and obesity. Special diets, exercise, and medications may be prescribed to manage hyperlipidemia and other lipid disorders</span></li>
                                    <li><span>A familial lipid disorder is a condition that causes very high levels of cholesterol. This condition can lead to early onset coronary artery disease (CAD).</span></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>There are different types of lipid disorders. They include:</p>
                                <ol class="green-numbered">
                                    <li>Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL)</li>
                                    <li>Familial defective apolipoprotein B-100</li>
                                    <li>Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type 3 hyperlipoproteinemia)</li>
                                    <li>Familial hypertriglyceridemia</li>
                                    <li>Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia</li>
                                </ol>
                                <div class="spacer-20"></div>
                                <p>Primary causes of dyslipidemias involve gene mutations that cause the body to produce too much LDL cholesterol or triglycerides, or the failure to remove these substances. Some causes involve underproduction or excessive removal of HDL cholesterol. Primary causes tend to be inherited and thus run in families. Multi-gene panel involving all the associated genes in dyslipidiema are available for genetic testing. MLPA may be required for testing deletion/ duplication in certain genes. For ex. sequence analysis of LDLR is performed  first followed by LDLR deletion/duplication analysis if no pathogenic variant is found in the case of Familial Hypercholesterolemia.</p>
