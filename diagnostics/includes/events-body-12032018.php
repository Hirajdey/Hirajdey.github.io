The main theme of this conference is growth disorders; a topic very close to pediatricians' hearts. The experts will take you beyond malnutrition to the fascinating molecular mechanisms which might be the basis for genetic therapy in near future!</p>",
	"<b>Dr. Kasthuri Kannan</b>, Assistant Professor of Pathology, Investigator, Genome Technology Center (GTC) Core Labs, NYU Langone Health<br><br>
	<b>Topic</b>: Genomics of Pineoblastoma<br><br>
	<p class='text-justify'>Dr. Kannan’s research interests are in genomics and computational biology. Rapid advancement of
	genomics technologies has enabled unbiased data-driven molecular approaches in medicine (as
	opposed to hypothesis based studies). Accordingly, he is interested in data-driven genomic
	analysis that leads to verifiable and useful hypotheses. His contributions to genomics include a
	comprehensive report of molecular alterations in adenoid cystic carcinoma and high-frequency
	ATRX mutations in astrocytoma.</p>

	<b>Dr. Rama Natarajan</b>, National Business Products Industry Professor in Diabetes Research, Professor and Chair, Department of Diabetes Complications and Metabolism, City of Hope Hospital<br><br>
	<b>Topic</b>: Epigenetic mechanisms underlying Diabetic complications and Metabolic Memory<br><br>
	<p class='text-justify'>Dr. Rama's major focus of our research is to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the
accelerated development of inflammation, vascular and renal complications observed under
diabetic conditions. Her research group is examining the role of epigenetics and non-coding RNAs
in the pathology of diabetic complications, and also how persistence of epigenetic changes can
create a “metabolic memory” that results in long term malfunction of genes and sustained
complications even after subject with diabetes bring their blood sugar under control.</p>

	"Seattle is one of the world’s centers of cancer immunotherapy. Three years ago, Xconomy gathered some of the field’s experts to talk about the promises of harnessing the immune system to fight cancer. Today, some of those promises seem well within reach, and a small but growing number of patients are benefiting from a handful of approved (and expensive) drugs. But while the opportunities seem closer at hand, many challenges remain. It’s time to gather again in Seattle to discuss what’s gone right, what’s gone wrong, and how the field’s brightest minds are working through the obstacles inherent when complicated biology, cutting-edge medical practice, and financial pressures meet.",
	"Cancer immunotherapy—the use of the immune system to treat cancer—is one of the most promising therapies to emerge since the development of chemotherapy in the mid-twentieth century. Harnessing the body's own innate defense mechanisms to attack cancer cells has demonstrated potential for developing treatments that are not only more efficacious (including long-lasting remissions and progression-free survival rates), but also more precise. Importantly, increased precision may reduce the toxicity that is often experienced with current pharmaceutical interventions. Different immunotherapeutic approaches, ranging from activating the patient's own immune response to attack cancer cells to neutralizing mechanisms designed to regulate and suppress patient's immune systems, are increasingly implemented in the regimen of oncology clinical care with positive results.
	<br>This 2-day scientific symposium will explore emerging findings in basic science, translational research, and clinical studies to improve immunotherapeutic approaches in cancer treatment. The event will convene basic, preclinical, and clinical researchers active in the field of cancer immunotherapy, alongside industry representatives and government stakeholders. Dr. Padmanee Sharma, Professor of Genitourinary Medical Oncology and of Immunology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, will commence the conference with a Keynote Address. Plenary speakers will present on an array of topics, including: the evaluation of combination therapy strategies to improve clinical benefit; the development of immune-monitoring strategies for the identification of relevant prognostic and predictive biomarkers; the development of strategies to overcome immune tolerance; and the incorporation of genomics into immunotherapeutic research and clinical trials.",
