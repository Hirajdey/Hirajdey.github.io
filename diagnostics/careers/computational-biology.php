		<h4>Company</h4>
		<p>MedGenome Inc. is a genomics-based diagnostics and research company delivering the best of health care by decoding genetic information contained in an individual’s genome. We are the first mover and market leader in genomics-based diagnostics and research from India with global offices in California.</p>

<p>Our mission is to improve global health by developing deep insights into diseases at the genetic and molecular level. Our research solutions apply cutting-edge genomics technologies, bioinformatics, computing, and big data analytics to the genetically diverse and large South Asian population to understand the genetic basis of cancer, metabolic disorders, eye disorders and other rare diseases. We also address important research questions in hereditary diseases, cardiovascular complications and neurological disorders.</p>

<p class="companylastpara">MedGenome was incubated for 2 years as a division of SciGenom Labs, Cochin, India. It was spun off as a separate company with headquarters in Narayana Health City, Bangalore in 2013. MedGenome’s core lab of 10,000 sq. ft. is based at Narayana Health City, Bangalore in the 3rd floor of Narayana Nethralaya building. MedGenome has a second lab of 5000 sq. ft. at the Special Economic Zone, in Kakanad, Cochin. MedGenome’s core strength is its multi-faceted team spread across the country, facilitating its pan India operations.</p>

		<div class="col-md-24 text-justify">
			<p>South Asian population, predominantly contributed by Indian sub-continent, represents a unique blend of genetically homogeneous, but socially and geographically stratified groups of individuals that can be leveraged to investigate complex diseases and disease phenotypes.  Although some studies have been published recently, no attempt has been made to develop a resource by systematically analyzing the South Asian Genome datasets.  In this study, we have analyzed 215 whole genomes sequences (WGS), 121 whole exomes sequences (WES), 324 whole genome array data (WGA) from individuals of five South Asian countries:  India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.  Additionally, we have integrated South Asian sample variants from 1000 Genome phase3 (1KGP) and ExAC South Asian variants.  Overall, the integrated database contains 49.7 million variants of which 44.5 million are SNVs and 5.2 million are short InDels. Interestingly, among these, 5.6 million variants were not present in the 1000Genome and ExAC databases, which includes South Asian genomes.  Of the total variants in the database, 21.8 million (43.8%) of the variants fall inside known genes and 1 million (0.3%) of these variants were found to be of coding non-synonymous type.  Copy number analysis of the 215 whole genome samples revealed 50,829 duplications and 67,984 deletions.  Analysis of mitochondrial genome revealed that majority of samples belongs to M (45%) haplogroup followed by U (20%) and H (13%) haplogroups.  The database is searchable using rs-id, position and gene name and shows allele frequencies statistics at three levels: super-population.</p>
