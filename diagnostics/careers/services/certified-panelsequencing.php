            <p>Gene Panel Sequencing is an approach to focus on specific mutations based on our genes/disease of interest.  Gene panels are built with selected group of genes or specific gene regions which are already confirmed to have been associated with certain diseases or phenotypes. One can get their own customized gene panels as per their requirements. Research can be done on multiple samples in parallel, as selective gene sequencing produces small volumes of data when compared to Whole Genome Sequencing.  </p>
            <p>MedGenome has state-of-the-art Next Generation Sequencing Illumina platforms Miseq, Hiseq 4000 / 2500 and X10 at its facilities in Foster City, California and Bangalore, India. </p>
