            <p>miRNA Sequencing is also a type of RNA-Seq with the only difference being that the input is enriched for small RNAs. miRNA enables researchers to study tissue-specific expression patterns, isoforms of miRNAs, disease relationships and to find out novel uncharacterized miRNAs. </p>
            <p>With unprecedented sensitivity and dynamic range, small RNA sequencing methods allow for the most accurate detection and quantification of rare small RNA sequences.</p>
