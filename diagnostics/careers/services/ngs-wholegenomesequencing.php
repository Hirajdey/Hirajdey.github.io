            <p>Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) provides complete information on genetic makeup of organisms, enabling researchers to study variations within the species and compare them with others which can help in solving unanswered puzzles in the Genomics and providing fuel for research for biomarker discovery and personalized medicine.</p>
            <p>MedGenome has state-of-the-art Next Generation Sequencing Illumina platforms Miseq, Hiseq 4000 / 2500 and X10 at its facilities in Foster City, California and Bangalore, India.</p>
            
            <p>WGS can reveal germline variation, Somatic Variation, Copy number variation, changes in Transposable Elements, and Structural variants.</p>
