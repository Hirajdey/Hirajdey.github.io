                <h2>TCR Sequencing</h2>
                <p class="tcr-first-para">T cells play a major role in immune system to identify the antigens, and site of action on surface of T cells (T-cell antigen receptor) provides valuable information in terms of any disease treatment. TCR Sequencing is to produce large number of short DNA fragments which forms the TCR coding regions. TCR-seq helps in characterization of human T-cell repertoire, which brings total understanding on TCRs, their frequency and distribution among individuals.</p>

                <p class="tcr-last-para">Advances in NGS technology lead to generation of large amounts of immune repertoire data. Considering the role of cellular immunity in human body, TCR seq is crucial in understanding of immune system, in biomedical discovery, and effective treatment of patients. TCR-seq includes PCR amplification and sequencing of the complementarity determining region (CDR) in one of the TCR subunits (shown in the above figure) as that region plays major role in immunity.</p>
