Comprehensive genetic analysis using MedGenome’s Neurology Gene Panel revealed potentially damaging mutations in HEXA gene instead thus leading to a confirmatory genetic diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease in the child. </p>

    <h2>When losing a fourth child was not an option</h2>

    <div class="col-md-24 text-justify">
        <p class="storyTxt"><span class="blueLetter">A</span>fter the loss of three children,this couple turned to genetic testing for hope. Exome sequencing at MedGenome revealed that both the parents were carriers of organic aciduria, carrying 50% of the identified genetic defect. This result will be used for prenatal testing when the couple plans for their next child.</p>

    <h2>Nipping cancer before it buds</h2>

    <div class="col-md-24 text-justify">
        <p class="storyTxt"><span class="lblueLetter">W</span>ith the father and son having the same mutation that leads to eye cancer, this couple approached MedGenome while expecting their second child. MedGenome’s genetic testing identified the mutation responsible for the cancer. When the same mutation was identified in the foetus’s DNA as well, it was possible to closely observe its development so as to find and treat the tumour at its nascent stages.</p>

    <h2>Keeping an eye out</h2>

    <div class="col-md-24 text-justify">
        <p class="storyTxt"><span class="greenLetter">H</span>is mother had a rare regressed eye cancer. Genetic testing unearthed a significant deletion of the RB1 gene in the child which required a preventive eye removal to mitigate risk. The mother, desirous of a second child, will now have the ability to prevent a recurrence in advance.</p>
